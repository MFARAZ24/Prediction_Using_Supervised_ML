# Prediction_Using_Supervised_ML
Task#1 of Spark Internship
In this task, I utilized the Pandas library of Python to import the data set to visualize the data to find any pattern within the data with the help of the Matplotlib library. Then, the data set was then trained for the linear regression model using the sk_learn library for Machine Learning. At last, the result was calculated for the particular value.
